# LinkedIn Automated Job Application Submitter
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  

- 🧑‍💻 This Python project is part of an introduction to web scraping using Selenium and will save job ads meeting criteria from the LinkedIn site.  Additionally, the company will be marked to follow - given that one's LinkedIn account is configured properly.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
